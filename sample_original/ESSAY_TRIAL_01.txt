In my opinion, cats are better pets than dogs 
because cats are easier to take care of as a pet. 
Cats don’t need much attention. 
When we cannot pay attention to them 
but we don’t have to feel guilty. 
Moreover, they are quieter 
and don’t disturb people in the family and neighborhood. 
It is important for pets to live as a member of the family or the community.
We don’t want to have any trouble. 
Some people say that cats are not friendly
and it’s not fun to be with.
So cats are not good pets at all.
But it is not true.
My family can get along with my cat very well
and we are very good friends.
Besides, there are some cats with friendly characters.
You can choose cats with friendly dispositions by asking the shop clerk.
Therefore, I believe cats are better than dogs as pets.
